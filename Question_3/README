#This Readme will show you how to run these scripts.

The Shell script run.sh would need one Argument:
	
	The path of mfeat-digits directory

In the mfeat-digits, the structure should looks like this:
	mfeat-digits/
		-mfeat-fac
		-mfeat-fou
		-mfeat-kar
		...

The run.sh would need the permission of reading these files, so please give permission to
these files in advance:
>chmod a+r [mfeat-digits directory] -R

Then:
./run.sh [mfeat-digits directory]
