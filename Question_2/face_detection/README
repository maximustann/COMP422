#This Readme will show you how to run the face detection program

First step: clean.
There are many generated results remain in the result directory.
If you want to clean them up and generate new result, please run clean.sh.
>./clean.sh

Second step: Generate Samples.

The shell script run.sh would need two Arguments: 

	1. The path of "test" directory
	2. The path of "train" directory

Both directories come from extracting the Compressed packages which were provided on the course home page.

In the "test" or "train" directory, the structure should looks like this:
	test/
		face/
		non-face/

	train/
		face/
		non-face/

The run.sh would need the permission of reading these files, so please give permission to these files advance:
>chmod a+r test -R
>chmod a+r train -R

Third step :Run the script.
./run.sh [test directory] [train directory]
